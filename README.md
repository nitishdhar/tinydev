<strong>Note:</strong> Tiny Dev is not a replacement for the major frameworks like <a href="http://cakephp.org">CakePHP</a>. Its only recommended in cases where you think you don't need a complex framework. I have developed this as a self required kit, hopefully this comes handy to few other developers.
